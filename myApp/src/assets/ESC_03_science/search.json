The muscles are attached to the bones by the tendons. Each time when we make a movement the muscles inflate and when we stop moving they get back to their relaxed position. We also have involuntary muscles or smooth muscles and voluntary muscles. The involuntary muscles are the ones that we don’t need to give an order so they can move, for example, the heart. The nervous system helps us to coordinate our movements, by giving the order to the muscles and so on, all our organs are connected.

It’s in charge too, of the memory, attention... etc. The Spinal cord is in the spinal column. Its most important function is to take through the nerves, the nervous current of sensations to the brain and nerve impulses leading brain responses to the muscles. The nerves are in all the body.

Humans use the respiratory system to breathe, but animals have different ways to get oxygen. There are animals that breathe under water and animals that breathe underground. Depending on the complexity of their bodies and the environment in which they live, animals evolved different systems to achieve respiration.

There are 6 kinds of forces which act on objects when they come into contact with one another. Remember, a force is either a push or pull. They are: Normal force: A book resting on a table has the force of gravity pulling it toward the Earth. Applied force: Is a force that is applied to an object, such as when a person moves a piece of furniture across the room or pushes a button. A force is applied. Frictional force: To stop a moving object, a force must act in the opposite direction to the direction of motion. The force that opposes the motion of an object is called friction. Tension force: Is the force applied to a cable or wire that is anchored on opposite ends to opposing walls or other objects. This causes a force that pulls equally in both directions. Spring force: It can pull or push in order to create a force. Resisting force: This forces change motion. When you pick up a pencil, it’s friction with your fingers that gets the pencil in motion.

From Earth, we see the Moon grow from a thin crescent to a full disk (or full moon) and then shrink back to a thin crescent again before vanishing for a few days. The lit part of the moon always points the way to the sun. The changing shape of the bright part of the Moon that we see is called its phase. The moon is illuminated because it reflects the light from the sun. The part of the moon facing the sun is lit up. The part facing away from the sun is in darkness. The phases of the Moon depend on its position in relation to the Sun and Earth. The phases of the moon work in a cycle starting with the new moon. The phases are named after how much of the moon we can see, and whether the amount visible is increasing or decreasing each day. It takes our moon about 29.5 days to completely cycle through all its phases. This is known as a Lunar month. radio13_73_s13_4Phases of the moon. radio14_73_s13_4Shadows at night. radio15_73_s13_4Environment disorders. radio16_73_s13_4Changes in weather. a b c d ","Science 3ES _calendario_ The alignment of the moon and the sun determines the phases of the moon. The crescent moon grows till it is about half full in the phase we call ‘first quarter’. From there it grows to full moon and then begins to shrink back to third quarter and finally back to new moon. Key facts: The curious (but also explainable) thing is, that both movements, rotation and translation, take the same time to complete a cycle; That’s why the same face of the moon is always pointing to the Earth.
