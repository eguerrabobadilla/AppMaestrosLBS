["b1_s0 ","General Introduction: Welcome to your science first grade LBS+ book! This book is interactive with activities that you will enjoy and have fun, meanwhile, you will learn and reinforce new things about you and your surroundings. Science education also seeks to ensure that you can locate the state of the environment in which you live in. Get to learn about your favorite places and how to get there. Learn about the compass rose and what we can find in the north, south, east and west and how to make or read a map. Study the problems of your local environment, related to science and technology as part of the culture of our country and the application of science and technology in production, that is how you can understand better your situation or the need for modification. The training that you get by studying science will have the aims to contribute to improving your living conditions, you will get prepared to understand the cause of some of the problems of our natural and social environment and thus be able to contribute to their improvement. ","b1_s1 This knowledge does not begin in school, since you were born you have been in a relationship with nature. The family and the cultural environment in which you live provide you with ideas of what is happening around. Science has a structure in a special way and is learned from what you can perceive with what you are told. When learning science, you can relate the knowledge to some of your experiences or to the ideas you have already built. You might not understand some of the explanations that science gives, no matter how much they are presented with activities and in an interesting way. For the same reason, you may understand your classmates better and accept new explanations given by your friends or people who think similarly to you. By this way you can modify your ideas. In this interaction with the social and natural environment, the habit of reflecting on reality is developed and with this you will gradually build your knowledge about it. The science and technology topics seen, depend on your interests of making new questions and getting to learn and experiment new things. What you are about to learn starts from all what you already know from your surroundings of the natural environment. All this learning builds in you a critical thinking, the way you make an analysis and the way you solve problems are all part of your ","science learning. You will enjoy working and learning with this book, also, to be introduced in the science world in an interactive way. ","Science 1 5 Trimester 1. 1. Getting along with my classmates. 2. Who am I? 3.

In this trimester we got to know the best way to get along with our classmates. Also, what a rule is and to stablish them or get to know the ones that are already set in our classroom. With activities on scientific topics, you developed new knowledge about the natural environment. In this trimester you learned to express your ideas so that others understand you. You can predict what can happen in certain situations. Identify your special characteristics and know that you are a different and unique individual with your own ideas. Recognize different parts of the body and the way you have to take care of yourself to stay healthy. Also, we learned where our school is and what special places are around it and how to get to them as well as how to get back to our home by using special references. We work by identifying the characteristics of the different places we can live in. The place where we live have special characteristics such as the weather and from that depends what material the houses can be made of, also, what animals we can find in the ","Science 1 72 surroundings. You identified things that are made by humans, that means that are artificial and are not in nature freely, they are invented or built by human beings. Natural things are the things that are not made by humans and they appear by different processes in the environment. Natural things are created over time due to natural processes such as evolution, all these differences are explained in this trimester. We also learned that all living things that can eat, move or react to the world through their senses can be human beings, but not all human beings are animals, and here is where we have to identify what animals are wild and what animals can be domesticated. The animals that we keep as companionship are the ones that we call pets. Some pets are for protection but most of them are good companions, but all of them need to be cared for, fed, and need attention. ","Knowledge Scientific Thinking. Science 1. Trimester 2.

The artificial light are the ones that are made by humans. Without any of these types of lights we couldn’t see the things around us. We worked with a topic that thought us how and what we can recycle.

We finished the third trimester and with it our 1st grade LBS+ science book. We have learned to help others and our own family by doing our house chores, even how to help planet earth by reducing the amount of garbage, and learning where garbage goes so, we can recycle it. We worked with different kind of objects identifying their characteristics like their softness, hardness, if it´s flexible, hard, light, rigid, or smooth and the types of movements used in an object, like push, pull or lift. Our family was the last topic seen in this trimester. Who makes up all our family members? We also, recognized that we all are unique individuals and valuable, and that we have the right to have an identity and to live in a family that cares, protects, and gives us love. ","b1_s1 "]
